# **CS Senior Design Project: HoloLens AR Application** 

## Project Overview

### **Problem** 
Children, unlike adults, cannot handle the entire dosages of medications.
Studies have shown that there is a 31% error rate across _all_ drugs administered to children by Emergency Medical Services (EMS), with medications such as midazolam and fentanyl having even higher rates at 61% and 65% respectively. 

### **Project Goals**
The goal of our project is to use the **Microsoft HoloLens 2** to develop a 3D augmented reality (_prototype_) application that acts as a codnitive aid and visual guide for EMS, with the aim of reducing prehospital pediatric medication errors.

Since this is a prototype, we will focus on 3 primary medications:
* Fentanyl
* Midazolam
* Epinephrine

along with 3 primary medical conditions:
* Burns
* Cardiac Arrest
* Seizures
